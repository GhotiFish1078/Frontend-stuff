                <h2>Quick Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Hog Rider is a character from the Clash Universe. His hometown is situated in Hog Mountain, which is where all other Hog Riders are born and raised,
                    before they inevitably leave, ready to forge their destiny. Typically, Hog Riders settle themselves in villages, where the Hog and the rider spend most of 
                    their time in the army barracks, preparing for their next raid. Out of all the Hog Riders who descend Hog Mountain, very few decide to test their mettle in the 
                    Clash Royale Arena, though, with the years of training throughout their youth, no opponent great or small can faze them. With his trustworthy hammer, and his
                    distinct mohawk, legend has is that the last thing any foe sees is the sillhouette akin to that of a sculpted greek god and the piercing battle cry "HOG RIDER!".
